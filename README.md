# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis from Scratch

In this repository, we have implemented a movie review sentiment analysis tool which rates the review and returns a fractional value between 0 and 1, where, 0 indicates negative and 1 being positive. For preprocessing, we have used the TFIDF algorithm from the Scikit-learn package. The main training has been done on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) written in C++ and [Arrayfire](http://arrayfire.org/docs/index.htm) which is capable of accelerating Linear Algebra operations on CPU as well as GPU using Intel MKL, OpenCL and CUDA.
