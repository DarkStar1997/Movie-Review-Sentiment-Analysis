# Movie Review Sentiment Analysis from Scratch

In this repository, we have implemented a movie review sentiment analysis tool which rates the review on a scale of 0 to 1. 0 being negative and 1 being positive. For preprocessing, we have used the TFIDF algorithm from the Scikit-learn package. The main training has been done on an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) written in C++ and Arrayfire which is capable of accelerating Linear Algebra operations on CPU as well as GPU using Intel MKL, OpenCL and CUDA.
